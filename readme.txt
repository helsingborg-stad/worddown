Export WordPress pages and posts to markdown files for AI chatbots with support for custom page builders and multilingual content.

== Description ==

Worddown is a powerful WordPress plugin that enables you to export your pages and posts to markdown files, making them perfect for integration with AI chatbots and other markdown-based systems.

= Key Features =

* Export pages and posts to markdown files
* Support for custom page builders (ACF Flexible Content, Elementor, etc.)
* REST API endpoints for programmatic access
* WP-CLI commands for automation
* Multilingual support
* Background export mode for large sites
* Customizable HTML content filters

= Export Methods =

1. WordPress Admin Dashboard
2. WP-CLI Commands
3. REST API Endpoints

= WP-CLI Support =

Export your content directly from the command line:

`wp worddown export`

For large sites, use background mode:

`wp worddown export --background`

= REST API =

Access export functionality programmatically through REST API endpoints:

* GET /wp-json/worddown/v1/files - List all exported markdown files
* GET /wp-json/worddown/v1/files/{post_id} - Get specific file content
* POST /wp-json/worddown/v1/export - Trigger export

= Custom HTML Content Filters =

Customize your markdown output using WordPress filters:

`add_filter('worddown_custom_html_content', function($content, $post_id, $post_type) {
    if ($post_type === 'page') {
        $content .= '<div>My custom HTML for page ' . $post_id . '</div>';
    }
    return $content;
}, 10, 3);`

= Available Translations =

* English
* Swedish (sv_SE)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/worddown` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin settings through the 'Worddown' menu item in the WordPress admin panel

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this with my custom page builder? =

Yes! Worddown provides filters that allow you to inject custom HTML content from any page builder before the markdown conversion process.

= Does it support multisite? =

Yes, Worddown works with WordPress multisite installations. You can use the --url parameter with WP-CLI commands to target specific subsites.

= How do I handle large exports? =

For large sites, we recommend using either the background mode via WP-CLI (`wp worddown export --background`) or the REST API with the background parameter enabled.

= How do I update translations or fix missing strings? =

Translations for plugins hosted on WordPress.org are delivered as **language packs** (files under `wp-content/languages/plugins/`). WordPress checks for newer packs when you check for updates.

* **Dashboard:** Go to *Dashboard → Updates* and use **Update translations** (when WordPress offers it), or update plugins/themes and let WordPress refresh translations in the same flow.
* **WP-CLI:** Run `wp language plugin update worddown` (or `wp language core update` to refresh all language data).
* **Automatic updates:** By default, WordPress can install translation updates in the background (`WP_AUTO_UPDATE_TRANSLATION` is true unless your host disables it).

New or changed strings appear in language packs after translators update them on [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/). You cannot force that from inside the plugin; releasing a new plugin version makes new strings available for translators, and updated `.mo` files reach sites through the normal translation update process.

If you use **Loco Translate** or placed a **custom** `worddown-*.mo` in `wp-content/languages/plugins/`, that file overrides the pack until you **re-sync** in Loco or **delete** the override so WordPress can download the current pack again.
